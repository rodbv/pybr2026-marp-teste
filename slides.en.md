# Your talk title

Python Brasil 2026 slide template

**Your name here** · @your_username

<!--
- We're glad you're speaking! Your own way of speaking matters more than any tip in this template.
- This file is a template: each example slide shows a layout and has tips in the speaker notes. Use the ones that work for you.
- To get started: keep an unchanged copy, choose the dark or the light version, and copy the slides you want to use. The _class comment at the top of each slide sets the layout.
- When you reuse a slide, delete these notes and write your own.
-->

---

<!-- _class: frase -->

# The room is cheering for you.

Every slide in this template has tips in the speaker notes: press P to see them.

<!--
- One idea per slide, in two lines at most. What sentence should the audience take home?
- Almost every speaker feels nervous. If you feel nervous, speak to one friendly face in the audience.
-->

---

<!-- _class: palestrante -->

# Your name here

### What you do · where

- The session chair often introduces you
- If time is short, you can skip this slide
- Describing yourself helps people who cannot see

<!--
- Replace the gray box with your photo: in the Markdown, replace img/foto-exemplo-en.png with the path to your photo.
- The session chair often introduces you; if time is short, you can skip this slide.
- Describing yourself helps people who cannot see. For example: “I'm Maria. I'm 1.60 m tall, with black hair worn down, green-framed glasses and a PyLadies T-shirt.”
-->

---

> Readability counts.

The Zen of Python, PEP 20

Tips, <mark>not rules</mark>: use the ones that work for you.

<!--
- Up to three lines, with who said it and where. Check the attribution in a primary source.
- The green quotation marks come from the theme: start the quote line with > and write the quote without quotation marks.
-->

---

## When you start

- Breathe out slowly before your first sentence
- The audience is on your side
- Speak calmly and breathe between sentences
- The talk is yours, at your own pace

<!--
- Three to five bullets per slide. If the text does not fit, split the content into two slides.
-->

---

## Agenda

1. The agenda shows where the talk is going
2. Three to five parts are usually enough
3. Come back to this slide between parts
4. Each part can open with a section slide
5. Optional: you can skip it if time is short

<!--
- The numbering is automatic.
- Coming back to the agenda between parts helps the audience know where they are.
-->

---

<!-- _class: secao -->
<!-- _paginate: false -->
<!-- _footer: "" -->

# _01_ One section for each part of the agenda

<!--
- The number between underscores goes into the lime circle: # _01_ Title. The number follows the order of the agenda.
-->

---

<!-- _class: duas-colunas -->

## Text on the slide

### Instead of

- Whole paragraphs
- Reading the slide aloud
- Shrinking the font to fit
- A script on the slide

### Try

- One idea per slide
- Saying what the slide doesn't
- Splitting it into two slides
- The script in the notes

<!--
- Each column has its own heading: before and after, problem and solution.
- The details and the script go in the speaker notes, which only you see.
-->

---

## Images that explain

![bg right:42%](img/imagem-exemplo-en.png)

- A diagram instead of a paragraph
- One image per idea
- Describe it for people who cannot see

<!--
- The gray box marks the place for your image: replace img/imagem-exemplo-en.png with the path to yours. With ![bg right:42%](file.png), the text fills the rest of the slide.
- Write alt text between the brackets of every image that is not a background.
- When you speak, say what the image shows, for people who cannot see it and for people who listen to the recording.
-->

---

## License and credit

![bg left:42%](img/imagem-exemplo-en.png)

- Your own photos or openly licensed ones
- Does the license allow this use?
- Credit the author on the slide
- At least 1000 px tall

<!--
- A portrait photo fills this space; a landscape photo is cropped at the sides. Change left to right to put the image on the right.
- Check that the photo's license allows use in a recorded talk, and credit it in the format “Photo: name, license, site”.
-->

---

<!-- _class: tres-imagens -->

## Readable screenshots

- ![Example screenshot](img/captura-exemplo-en.png) Only the part that matters
- ![Example screenshot](img/captura-exemplo-en.png) Increase the font size first
- ![Example screenshot](img/captura-exemplo-en.png) No passwords, tokens or emails

<!--
- Replace each gray box with your screenshot: replace img/captura-exemplo-en.png with the path to the screenshot, and describe the screenshot between the brackets.
- Before you take the screenshot, zoom in on the browser or increase the terminal font size.
- Check that the screenshot does not show passwords, tokens, emails, open tabs or notifications.
-->

---

## Code in color

```python
@dataclass
class Talk:
    title: str
    duration_min: int = 25

    def fits_in_slot(self, slot_min: int) -> bool:
        # Keep 5 minutes for questions
        return self.duration_min + 5 <= slot_min
```

![bg right:22% 70%](img/sticker-mago.png)

<!--
- If your talk has no code, you can skip this slide.
- Up to 8 lines and 60 columns. If the snippet is longer, split it across slides or show only what matters.
- Marp adds syntax highlighting for you: open the block with ```python, or with the language of the snippet.
-->

---

<!-- _class: duas-colunas miuda -->

## A smaller example teaches too

### Too small to read 😟

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@dataclass
class Talk:
    title: str
    start: datetime
    duration_min: int = 25

    @property
    def end(self) -> datetime:
        return self.start + timedelta(minutes=self.duration_min)

    def overlaps(self, other: "Talk") -> bool:
        return self.start < other.end and other.start < self.end

    def fits_in_slot(self, slot_min: int) -> bool:
        # Keep 5 minutes for questions
        return self.duration_min + 5 <= slot_min
```

### Readable from the back 😊

```python
def fits(talk, slot):
    # 5 min for questions
    needed = talk.duration + 5
    return needed <= slot
```

<!--
- Before and after a refactoring, or two ways to solve the same problem.
- Each column fits lines of up to 30 characters. The left column, with the miuda class, shows how tiny text looks on the big screen.
- Emoji are a tool too: a sad or a happy face shows at once which side is the example to avoid. The heading says the same in words, for people who cannot see the emoji.
-->

---

<!-- _class: numeros -->

## Three numbers that help

- **18** point font: readable from the back row
- **1** rehearsal out loud shows how long the talk takes
- **5** minutes for questions at the end

<!--
- Up to three numbers, each with a label for what it measures.
- The number goes in bold at the start of the item: - **18** label.
-->

---

<!-- _class: cartoes -->

## Before you go on stage

1. **Live coding** Plan B: screenshots or a video of the demo.
2. **Internet** With videos and pages downloaded, you don't depend on the network.
3. **PDF** Bring the slides as a PDF on a USB drive.

<!--
- Choose the plan B that fits your talk, and rehearse the switch to it on your computer.
- With back-to-back talks, there is not always time for a sound check; a captioned video works without audio.
-->

---

## The day of your talk

| When | Suggestion |
|---|---|
| Before the event | Ask questions in the speakers' Telegram group |
| The day before | Go easy on the karaoke :P Rest your voice and sleep well |
| On the day | Arrive early and get to know the room |
| 15 min before | Say hello to the room volunteers |
| During the talk | Keep the mic close, even when facing the screen |
| After | Upload your slides to the link in your QR code |

<!--
- Markdown tables get the lime header from the theme.
- If you test your video adapter and screen mirroring at home, the day is calmer.
- Every room has a volunteer. Projector, microphone, courage: whatever you need, we will help.
-->

## Which Python version do you use?

Sample data. To change the data, see the notes on this slide.

<!--
- Marp has no built-in charts: the chart is an image made with matplotlib. Change the labels and values in scripts/grafico.py and run uv run scripts/grafico.py.
- Write the chart numbers in the alt text, for screen readers.
- One chart, one message: say out loud what the audience should see in the bars.
-->

---

<!-- _class: fluxo -->

## A day at the conference

1. Talks
2. Coffee break
3. Lightning talks
4. PyBar

<!--
- A flow shows a sequence: the steps of a process, the stages of a pipeline, the schedule of the day.
- Walk through the flow from left to right: first, then, finally.

Photo caption. Photo: Person's Name · CC BY 4.0

<!--
- Replace the file in ![bg](...). The caption is the last paragraph of the slide.
- Credit the photo in the caption, as in the example.

# Your talk title

Light version, for bright rooms

**Your name here** · @your_username

<!--
- In a very bright room or with a dim projector, the light background is easier to read.

# _02_ A pause to breathe and drink water

<!--
- Between one part and the next, pause: breathe and take a sip of water.
- A pause feels long to the speaker and short to the audience.
-->

---

<!-- _class: light -->

## Your screen on the big screen

- Notifications off (Do Not Disturb)
- A neutral wallpaper
- Only the tabs and apps for the talk
- Private window: no history suggestions as you type

<!--
- The big screen shows everything on your screen: turn on Do Not Disturb before you go on stage.
- In a private window, the browser does not suggest addresses from your history.
-->

---

<!-- _class: duas-colunas light -->

## Rehearsing out loud helps

### Rehearse

- With a timer
- With someone watching
- On the computer you will present from

### Cut

- What runs over time
- Details that belong in the notes
- Slides you skip in rehearsal

<!--
- Rehearsing out loud shows how long the talk takes and makes your delivery more relaxed.
-->

---

<!-- _class: light -->

## Accessible images

![bg right:42%](img/imagem-exemplo-en.png)

- Alt text on every image
- A short caption if the image is not obvious
- Color and emoji help, but not on their own

<!--
- Colors and emoji communicate well, but they cannot be the only difference: some people in the audience are color blind, have low vision or use a screen reader.
- Pair color with a label or an icon: instead of a green dot and a red dot, also write “passed” and “failed”.
- All text in the template has a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 or more against the background. If you use other colors, check them at webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker.
-->

---

<!-- _class: light -->

## Talk to the room

![bg left:42%](img/imagem-exemplo-en.png)

- Look at the audience, if that feels comfortable
- Speaker notes for support
- Point with words, not with the mouse

<!--
- Only you see the speaker notes, in presenter view. Looking at your notes on stage is normal.
- In the exported HTML, press P: presenter view shows the notes, the next slide and the timer.
-->

---

<!-- _class: light -->

## Code in color

```python
@dataclass
class Talk:
    title: str
    duration_min: int = 25

    def fits_in_slot(self, slot_min: int) -> bool:
        # Keep 5 minutes for questions
        return self.duration_min + 5 <= slot_min
```

**Tip:** the card stays dark on the light slide, so the code keeps the same contrast.

<!--
- To get colored code, see the notes on the “Code in color” slide in the dark section.
-->

---

<!-- _class: light -->

> <mark>Pessoas</mark> &gt; Tecnologia

Python Brasil community, 2016

<!--
- On the white background, highlight the main word with the lime green highlighter, <mark>word</mark>, and keep the text black.
- The motto of the Python Brasil community since 2016.
-->

---

<!-- _class: frase light -->

# Less text, larger font.

<!--
- With less text on the slide, the font gets larger and the audience's attention stays on you.
-->

---

<!-- _class: destaque light -->

## Speak in a welcoming way

- Show the steps instead of saying it is easy
- Explain each acronym the first time
- Ask who has used it instead of assuming

<!--
- The lime green panel holds the message the room should not miss, with up to four short bullets beside it.
- For beginners, “it's just” and “everyone knows” sound like “you should know this”.
- For many people, Python Brasil is their first conference; an everyday example helps newcomers.
-->

---

<!-- _class: cartoes light -->

## After the talk

1. **Notes** Write down what worked, for your next talk.
2. **Chat** Stay nearby: many questions come up in the hallway.
3. **Rest** Enjoy the rest of the event. You earned it.

<!--
- If you write down what worked right after the talk, your next talk benefits.
- Feeling tired after speaking is normal: take a break and enjoy the rest of the event.
-->

---

<!-- _class: palestrante light -->

# Your name here

### Pronouns, role and community

- Where the audience can find you
- Three facts, not a résumé
- A recent photo

<!--
- With your pronouns on the slide, people who mention your talk can refer to you correctly.
-->

---

<!-- _class: fluxo light -->

## From draft to stage

1. Write Markdown
2. Rehearse aloud
3. Export to PDF
4. Present

<!--
- A numbered list becomes boxes with arrows; the last step is lime.
- Three to five steps fit on one line. For a flow with branches, split it into two slides.
-->

- During questions, repeat each question into the microphone, for the room and the recording.
- “I don't know, but I can check and get back to you” is a good answer. A question that breaks the code of conduct does not need an answer.
- From the organizers: we're so happy to have you at Python Brasil 2026. We're here to support you and cheer for you.

## Stickers

### Dazumbanho! Chegasse ao fim, ixtepô!

![w:290](img/lockup-on-dark.png) ![w:190](img/sticker-witch.png) ![w:220](img/sticker-mago-ola.png) ![w:130](img/sticker-mago.png) ![w:120](img/magia-explosao.png)

![w:280](img/logo-assinatura.png) <span class="circulo">look here</span> <mark>highlighter</mark> ![w:96](img/icone-seta.png) ![w:96](img/icone-codigo.png)

Visual identity by Ana Terhorst, [anaterhorstdesign.com](https://anaterhorstdesign.com). Thanks, Ana!

<!--
- “Dazumbanho! Chegasse ao fim, ixtepô!” is an expression in the Florianópolis (manezinho) dialect, roughly “Wow! You made it to the end, look at that!”.
- Copy the sticker line into your slide; w:200 sets the width in pixels.
- The highlighter sticker is live text: change its word, or use <mark>word</mark> on a word of your own. The pixelated circle is <span class="circulo">word</span>.
- One sticker per slide is usually enough.
-->
